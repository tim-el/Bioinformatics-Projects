# Bioinformatics-Projects

## This Repo contains examples of advanced Bioinformatics code developed during my time at UCSC, in Jupyter notebook format.
File development was guided by UCSC professors, the Rosalind Bioinformatics Platform, and my personal tool development

#### UCSC Coursework:
- LotkaVolterra.ipnyb: Stochastic Modeling of Lotka-Volterra Interactions
- PBWT.py: Implementing Efficient Haplotype matching using the Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform
- Neural_Net_Classifier: Training a neural network to identify the tissue type that produced an RNA expression vector
- Needleman-Wunsch: Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute the optimal alignment for a pair of sequences
